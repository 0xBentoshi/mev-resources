Hey! Welcome to this repo. I have organised all the mev stuff I've been seeing, and have also given a brief description where possible. 
I summarise the key points of each resource (video/blog/article) that I finish at my [substack](https://0xbentoshi.substack.com/). 
The ones I have not summarised yet have a star next to them. These summaries are part of a journal that tracks my mev journey -- from a (literal) noob to a (hopefully) profitable searcher.
Happy learning!

### Other Stuff
MEV has 3 parts: 
- locate prey (get data-be it pending txs, pair-wise prices at various DEXs or anything else)
- see if it's worth chasing the prey (format the data to enter your logic, this logic is the logic of your strategy)
- go for the kill (if enough profit available, make calls to your smart contracts to execute smart contracts)

If you didn't get the above, don't worry. I haven't understood it enough myself to explain it succintly. The main thing here is your perserverance and you just not giving up. That's literally the only thing here. That's why there's few ppl in this space bec it "seems" intimidating. 

If I, a noob lvl 9000 coder can get on this journey, then so can you anon. First, you need to know the various tools needed (like nodejs for runtime, js for codign the strategy/logic, smart contracts that will deploy your strategy), then go through how other ppl have done it and then finally launch the shittiest v0 of your bot. Once this is done you will continue on your own.

Also, the mev community is absolute pogchamp. The reason I got into mev and coding in crypto is simply bec i was feeling a little lonely and craved a sense of community. I think I have found that here. Also, I love a good challenge, especially taking on something that looms in front of me like a tower. Feel free to ask *sensible* questions to the pogchamps in this space (I have a list on my Twitter if you want some names) and have fun. 

See you in the mempool, anon ðŸ˜‰
